# train and transfer share the same options that are necessary to run xiML, here is a brief rundown:
# include: bool, True | False, set this to True if you want to include train / transfer scenarios
# load: bool, True | False, set this to True if you just want to load the previously saved
#                           label encoder
# engine: str, search engine that was used to generate the input data. Valid options are:
# xi, xifdr, xionline, xioffline
# linear: bool, True | False, if True indicates that this psms table is from linear identifications
# psms_loc: str, location of the PSMS you want to use for training / transfer
# ncv: int, cross-validation mode. Must be at least 3, 5 is recommended.
# mode: str, train | crossval | predict:
# train - will train the classifier in a special setup, dividing the data into 60/15/15 for
#         train/val/test splits. Does not use cross-validation (ncv) parameter
#         => should be used for training a classifier to be used on a different data set

# crossval - will train the classifier in a cross-validation manner using 5 equally sized folds
#            substracting the test_frac data as final evaluation data.
#           => should be used for hyperparameter optimization

# predict - core mode of the tool to use the predictions for later rescoring of PSMS. The folds
#           will be divided into train/train/train/validation/test, where validation is used for
#           early stopping and test for the prediction.
#           => should be used for usage in xiML-rescoring afterwards.
# test_frac: float, fraction of data to be used for testing. In Train mode also defines how many
#            samples are left out for training.
