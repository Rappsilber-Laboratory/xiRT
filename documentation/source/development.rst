xiRT - development
===================

This section covers some guidelines for the development of xiRT.

Preparing a new release
***********************
The preparation include to run all tests locally and make sure that they pass. In addition,
the test coverage badge needs to be generated by calling:

```
>coverage-badge -o documentation/imgs/coverage.svg -f
```

If everything passes, the documentation needs to generated. Make sure to include
new pages in the index page and build the documentation by calling:

```
>sphinx-build -b html documentation/source documentation/build
```


Publishing a new release
************************
To release a new version two steps are necessary:
1) create the PyPi release
2) create the github release

For 1) execute the following command and have the PyPi and github credentials and hand:
```
>python setup.py upload
```

Make sure to bump the version number with the last commit before executing the setup file. This will
automatically generate a tag in github along the PyPi package.

2) Can be done via the github project page. Simply navigate to the "create release" page and upload
the binaries / wheels that have been generated with the setup.py file. Make sure tom summarize the
changes to the last version.
